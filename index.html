			<p>Hi There! You have found my page! My name is Shaina Veloz and I am originally from the Bronx,NY but I was also raised in Miami,FL. I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelors of Science degree in Psychology and I am currently enrolled within the UCF Coding Bootcamp with hopes of learning more about coding and eventually being able to work within the gaming industry. 
			One of my hobbies/love is spending my time at the gym. If I am not learning to code then I am more than likely at the gym. It really is my safe haven, if I am having a stressful day it is tehe perfect release. Even when I am having an amazing day, it is my place to celebrate. It is my place of zen. I also LOVE PUPPIES!!!</p>
